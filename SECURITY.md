# Security Policy

🛡️ Found a security issue in a [Stenic](https://github.com/stenic) project? Read on.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities should be reported to oss-maintainers@stenic.io - which is a private, maintainer-only group. Maintainers will attempt to respond to/confirm reports within 2-3 days, but if you believe your report to be "critical" to user safety and security, please note as such in the subject.

When reporting an issue, where possible, please provide at least:

- The project and commit version the issue was identified at
- A proof of concept (plaintext; no binaries)
- Steps to reproduce
- Your recommended remediation(s), if any.

> Note: Please do not open public issues for security issues, as GitHub does not provide facility for private issues, and deleting the issue makes it hard to triage/respond back to the reporter.
