We'd love for you to contribute to the **[@stenic](https://github.com/stenic)** packages, as long as you keep in mind a
few useful rules of thumb:

- Open a brief proposal (use the "Feature Request" template) discussing your idea _before_ you start implementing! We
  can't accept every change to the API, as the Gorilla Toolkit is widely used by users of all kinds.
- Be prepared to write (or ask for help with!) writing/updating tests: we want to make sure things work, and good tests
  help cover edge cases & prevent regressions. In many cases, they also help demonstrate the usage of the feature!
- Work with us on adding documentation for your proposal - to the `README`, as godoc comments, and as part of the
  release changelog/good commit messages.
